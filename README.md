#### By Noah Yasskin & Maldon Meehan

## Description
This was an Exercise to practice inheritance and cascading styles.
* Create a new web page for an animal shelter. List out the animals available to be adopted, including pictures and descriptions of each animal. Have at least 3-5 animals listed. Don't forget to set up a git repository, make frequent commits and push to a remote repository on GitHub.
* Display each animal's "profile" in a column.
Change the styles of elements nested within the columns using the idea of cascading.
* Find other places in your web pages where you can change elements on the page according to cascading precedence.
* The Full lesson can be found
